The programs found here were used in conjunction to better understand the physics of automated glider control.

These programs all create data visualisations, for use in interpretation and as visual aids for client-centred communication.

The associated import data files have also been included, should one wish to run the program. The filepaths must be edited for your personal system, however.

Hopefully you will find these interesting to look at!
